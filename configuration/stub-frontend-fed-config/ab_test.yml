# Experiments should follow the above structure.
# While a test is running, only the percentages should change. Only use whole numbers.
# To make all users see the winning alternative, all the other alternatives should be removed, e.g.
#
#  experiments:
#   - about_companies:
#       alternatives:
#         - name: 'no_logo'
#           percent: 100
#
# The value reported to Piwik will be the experiment name followed by the alternative name, e.g. "about_companies_with_logo"
# Only the current experiment should have multiple alternatives so that Piwik reports just that experiment.
# The first alternative will be used as the default for any issues.
# This file must exist and must contain at least:

# Note that the 'preview' short_hub_2019_q3 experiment will need to appear simultaneously
# with the 'real' experiment', until a verify-frontend that does not depend upon the existence
# of the 'preview' has been deployed.
